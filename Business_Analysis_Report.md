### **Business Analysis & System Specification Document**

**Project:** Document Quality Assessment for OCR
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-15

### 1. Executive Summary

This project provides an automated system designed to pre-emptively assess the quality of digital documents (PDF, TIFF) before they are sent for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The primary business goal is to **reduce OCR failures, improve data extraction accuracy, and lower operational costs** associated with processing low-quality or corrupted files.

By validating documents against a configurable set of quality criteria, the system ensures that only viable documents proceed to the resource-intensive OCR stage, thereby increasing the efficiency and reliability of the entire data processing pipeline.

### 2. Business Problem & Opportunity

**Problem:**
- In many automated workflows (e.g., invoice processing, claims management, digital archiving), documents are ingested from various sources with inconsistent quality.
- Submitting low-quality documents (blurry, skewed, low-resolution) to an OCR engine results in high error rates, requiring costly manual review and correction.
- Corrupted or unreadable files can cause the entire processing pipeline to fail, leading to operational delays and requiring technical intervention.

**Opportunity:**
- By implementing an automated quality gate, the business can significantly improve the Straight-Through Processing (STP) rate.
- Proactively identifying and flagging bad documents allows for faster remediation, such as requesting a better-quality version from the source.
- This system provides a clear, objective, and auditable trail for why a document was rejected, improving transparency and governance.

### 3. Proposed Solution & Scope

The system is a command-line application that ingests a list of documents and evaluates each one against a series of technical and visual quality criteria.

**In-Scope Functionality:**
- Batch processing of documents via a JSON input file.
- Support for PDF, TIFF, and common image formats.
- Evaluation based on 10 distinct quality criteria.
- Flexible configuration to enable/disable criteria and adjust thresholds.
- Generation of a JSON output file with a clear `isAccepted` status and detailed results for each document.
- Comprehensive logging for auditing and troubleshooting.

**Out-of-Scope Functionality:**
- Real-time document processing via an API (potential future enhancement).
- Document remediation or quality improvement (e.g., auto-skew correction). The system is for assessment only.
- The OCR process itself.

### 4. Key Quality Criteria & Business Rules

The system evaluates documents based on criteria defined in `criteria_config.json`. These are categorized to enforce business rules:

| Category | Type | Business Impact | Criteria Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blocker** | `required` | Failure leads to **automatic rejection**. These issues make OCR impossible or highly unreliable. | `File Integrity`, `Resolution`, `Brightness`, `Blur` |
| **High Priority** | `recommended` | Failure generates a **warning** but does not cause rejection. Indicates a potential for poor OCR results. | `Skew`, `Missing Pages`, `Text Density`, `Noise` |
| **Low Priority** | `warning` | Failure is noted for informational purposes. Unlikely to severely impact OCR. | `Watermark`, `Compression Artifacts` |

A key feature is the **Smart DPI Estimation**. If a document's metadata reports a low resolution, the system analyzes the content to estimate the *actual* DPI. A document is only rejected if both the metadata and the estimated DPI are below the required threshold, preventing false rejections due to faulty metadata.

### 5. Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role & Interest |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Business Operations Team** | Primary users. Rely on the system to ensure smooth processing of documents and reduce manual work. |
| **IT/Development Team** | Responsible for maintaining, deploying, and extending the system. |
| **Data Science Team** | May use the output to analyze the quality of incoming documents and refine OCR models. |
| **Compliance/Audit Team** | May use the logs and output files to ensure processing standards are met. |

### 6. Technical Overview

- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Core Libraries:** OpenCV, Pillow (for image processing), PyMuPDF (for PDF handling), Pydantic (for data validation).
- **Architecture:** A single-threaded, sequential processing pipeline. It is CPU-bound and does not require a GPU.
- **Deployment:** Deployed as a command-line tool, executed via a shell script (`run.sh`). It is suitable for containerization (e.g., Docker).

### 7. Business Analyst Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions to maximize the value of this project:

1.  **Review and Calibrate Thresholds:** The default thresholds in `criteria_config.json` (e.g., `min_dpi: 200`) are a good starting point. I recommend conducting a workshop with the Business Operations team to process a sample batch of historical "good" and "bad" documents. This will allow you to fine-tune the thresholds to match real-world business needs and avoid rejecting acceptable documents.

2.  **Develop a Rejection Workflow:** The current system effectively flags bad documents, but what happens next? A formal workflow should be designed. For example:
    *   Rejected documents are moved to a "quarantine" folder.
    *   An automated notification is sent to the relevant team/person.
    *   A process is established for requesting a higher-quality document from the client or source.

3.  **Plan for Scalability (Phase 2):** The current sequential processing model is adequate for moderate volumes. If the number of documents is expected to exceed thousands per day, I recommend prioritizing the implementation of **parallel processing**. This would involve modifying the application to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores, significantly reducing total runtime for large batches.

4.  **Expose as an API (Phase 2):** For better integration with other enterprise systems, consider wrapping the core logic in a REST API. This would allow other applications to request a quality check in real-time without relying on file-based exchange, making the solution more robust and scalable.
